# TwitchMMLevelPickerGUI
Twitch bot which semi-randomly picks Mario Maker 2 Levels from chat, with a GUI

---

# Explanation
When the bot has started, it will open up this GUI:

The bot connected to this GUI will, when "Run" is pressed, allow chat members to add their levels to the drawing. When the streamer wishes to play a level, they can semi-randomly generate a level to play from the list of levels. It's possible to give subscribers a higher chance of winning this drawing, based on how many months they have been subscribed.  

In short, this bot allows streamers to fairly pick chat levels with just one click.

This bot is similar to my [Twitch Mario Maker Level Queue](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchMMLevelQueueGUI). However, the bot in this repository semi-randomly picks levels from the list of all added levels, giving better odds to people who have been subscribed for longer, while the [Level Queue](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchMMLevelQueueGUI) uses a queue which does not give advantages to subscribers.

# Odds

The odds each person has by default is `1`. We will call this the weight of their entry.

The weight is incremented by a bonus weight, based on how many months they have been subscribed to the streamer. The parameter MonthsPerChance in the [Settings](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchMMLevelPickerGUI/blob/master/README.md#Settings) file determines how many months of subscriptions counts for 1 extra weight.

If this MonthsPerChance value is set to 6, someone with 11 months of subscriptions will have `11 / 6 = 1.8333...` additional weight per roll. This would mean they have `1 + 1.8333... = 2.8333...` weight, while someone who is not subscribed has the standard `1`. This means that the person with 11 months of subscriptions is `2.8333... / 1 = 2.8333...` times as likely to win the roll.

# Settings
This bot is controlled by a settings.txt file, which looks like:
```
{
    "Host": "irc.chat.twitch.tv",
    "Port": 6667,
    "Channel": "#<channel>",
    "Nickname": "<name>",

        "moderator"
    ],
    "AllowedPeople": [],
    "MonthsPerChance": 6
}
```

| **Parameter**        | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Host                 | The URL that will be used. Do not change.                         | "irc.chat.twitch.tv" |
| Port                 | The Port that will be used. Do not change.                        | 6667 |
| Channel              | The Channel that will be connected to.                            | "#CubieDev" |
| Nickname             | The Username of the bot account.                                  | "CubieB0T" |
| Authentication       | The OAuth token for the bot account.                              | "oauth:pivogip8ybletucqdz4pkhag6itbax" |
| AllowedRanks  | List of ranks required to be able to perform the commands. | ["broadcaster", "moderator"] |
| AllowedPeople | List of users who, even if they don't have the right ranks, will be allowed to perform the commands. | ["cubiedev"] |
| MonthsPerChance | How many months of total subscriptions on the current channel should count for 1 extra chance in the drawing. See [Odds](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchMMLevelPickerGUI#Odds) for more information. | 6 |

*Note that the example OAuth token is not an actual token, but merely a generated string to give an indication what it might look like.*

I got my real OAuth token from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/.

# GUI
For reference, this is the GUI:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37621491/60506964-55989a00-9cc7-11e9-8381-dec8f24be42a.png)

Let's clarify the functionality from the GUI:

| **Button** | **Action** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Auth | This button will hide or unhide your Authentication token. This way you can hide it when you aren't changing it, so that it will not leak. |
| Run | This button is both "Stop" and "Run" at the same time. When the bot is running, the button will say Stop. While it is not, it will display "Run". Pressing this button will either stop the bot from running, or start the bot using the information filled in above. | 
| Pick Next Level | Equivalent to typing `!nextlevel` in chat. Picks the next level. |
| Clear: <date> | Clears the list of levels. The date shows when the list of levels was last cleared. |

In addition to these buttons, there is a textbox which will automatically fill with chat levels.
This chat box consists of two sections, seperated by a dotted line.

The level above the line is the current level. This is the one you should play, and also the one which your chat members will get to see when they type `!currentlevel`.

Below the line are all levels that have a chance to become the next level. They are shown in case you really want to play a level by a certain user, you can quickly look at which code they entered.

# Requirements
* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Module requirements](requirements.txt)<br>
Install these modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Among these modules is my own [TwitchWebsocket](https://github.com/CubieDev/TwitchWebsocket) wrapper, which makes making a Twitch chat bot a lot easier.
This repository can be seen as an implementation using this wrapper.
